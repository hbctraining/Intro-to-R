## Introduction to R

| Audience | Computational skills required | Duration |
:----------|:-------------|:----------|
| Biologists | None | 1.5 or 2-day workshop (~ 9 - 13 hours of trainer-led time)|

### Description
This repository has teaching materials for a hands-on **Introduction to R** workshop. The workshop will introduce participants to the basics of R and RStudio. R is a simple programming environment that enables the effective handling of data, while providing excellent graphical support. RStudio is a tool that provides a user-friendly environment for working with R. 

These materials are intended to provide both basic R programming knowledge and its application for increasing efficiency for data analysis. 

> These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop, but also amenable to self-guided learning.

### Learning Objectives

1. **R syntax**: Understand the different 'parts of speech'.
2. **Data types structures in R**: Describe the various data types and data structures.
3. **Data inspection and wrangling**: Demonstrate the utilization of functions and indices to inspect and subset data from various data structures.
4. **Visualizing data**: Demonstrate the use of the ggplot2 package to create plots for easy data visualization.
